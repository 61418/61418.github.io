# Submission Standards

61418 curates durable and thoughtfully designed tooling in and around the AWS ecosystem.

We are not an incubator for experiments nor a vanity umbrella for personal repositories. Projects admitted under the 61418 banner are expected to be maintained with genuine care, seriousness, aesthetic coherence, and long-term stewardship in mind.

Members believe infrastructure should be deliberate, legible, durable, and beautiful, not accidental. 

## What We Look For

For a project to be considered for inclusion in 61418’s catalog, it must satisfy the following principles:

### 1. It addresses a real gap

- The project must resolve a genuine and existing deficiency within the AWS ecosystem (or an adjacent domain).
- If similar tools exist, your project must demonstrate a clear and meaningful advantage, for example:
    - A previously abandoned but necessary solution, revived and responsibly maintained.
    - A re-architecture of an existing tool that resolves long-standing issues.
    - A materially better developer experience or performance profile.
- We are not interested in superficial rewrites or marginal variations.

### 2. It Is Built for Longevity

- Projects must demonstrate clear intention toward long-term maintainability and clarity.
- For Python projects, this currently includes:
    - Dependency management with uv
    - Linting and formatting with ruff
    - Docstrings adhering to numpydoc standards
    - Comprehensive documentation generated with a modern tool (e.g., Sphinx) and a clean, minimal theme (e.g., Furo)
    - Documentation must include:
        - Clear usage examples
        - Caveats and tradeoffs
        - Architectural decisions where relevant
    - All hosted documentation must conform to 61418’s visual identity, including logos and favicon usage from the 61418 logo catalog.
    - Tooling standards may evolve over time, but consistency and legibility are non-negotiable.

### 3. It Reflects Craft

- Code quality matters. Naming matters. Documentation matters. Visual coherence matters.
- We are building a catalog of tools that reflect care, not just utility.
- If a project is admitted to 61418, it represents not only its maintainer, but the collective.

## Stewardship Expectations

Submitting a project to 61418 implies a commitment to maintain it thoughtfully over the long term.

We are not interested in abandoned experiments or resume-padding artifacts. We are interested in durable tools that the AWS community can rely on.

Projects may remain under their original authorship, but admission to 61418 implies alignment with its standards and philosophy.

## How to Submit

If your project meets these criteria and you are committed to maintaining it with seriousness and care, please contact general@61418.io.

If your project does not yet exist but you have a strong concept addressing a meaningful gap, you may also reach out. We are open to collaboration when the vision is clear and the standards are shared.
