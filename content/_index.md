61418 is an independent open-source software collective born February 24th, 2026.

It was founded by [Mike Letts](https://github.com/michaelthomasletts) in order to bring together software engineers who build and maintain open-source software which enhance the AWS Python SDK and general AWS ecosystem.

61418 has a bias for Python and modern Python tools like Furo, uv, etc. We are open to maintaining projects written in other languages as well, so long as they are thoughtful, modern, and bring value to the AWS ecosystem.

To see which projects 61418 maintains, check out our [GitHub](https://github.com/61418).
